# Flower AI App

This project is a Flower AI App that uses a Flask server for the backend and a React.js client for the frontend.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

- `flask-server`: This directory contains the Flask server that serves as the backend for the application.
- `client`: This directory contains the React.js client that serves as the frontend for the application.
